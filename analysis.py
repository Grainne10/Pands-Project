# This project is for the programme and scripting module in the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics
# It is based on the Fisher's Iris Data Set
# Author Grainne Boyle

# The first step is to import Pandas, a python library used for working with datasets
import pandas as pd

# Next I load the Iris data set into a data frame using df in pandas
df = pd.read_csv("C:\Users\grain\Desktop\cmder\pands\pands-project\iris.data")
