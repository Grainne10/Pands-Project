I work a [TE Connectivity] (https://www.te.com/usa-en/home.html)

This repository contains the files for the project for the Programme and Scripting module in the Higher Diploma in Science in Data Analytics.

Description
This project is based on the [Iris Data Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). For the project I must research the data set and write documentation and code in Python to investigate the data set, with a view to explaining it to my colleagues.I may be asked to give a presentation on the data , where I explain what investigating a data set entails and how Python can be used to do it. 

Python Script
* Read in the Iris Data  CSV from a URL
* Import pandas to work on the data set using data frames
* Create a summary of the data using tables
* Test the data form missing values
* Use Numpy for working with arrays







Background
This project is based on the [Iris Data Set](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set). The Fisher’s Iris data set  is a multivariate data set made famous by the statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher. It is sometimes called Anderson’s Iris data set because Edgar Anderson collected the data to quantify the morphologic variation of Iris flowers of three related species. Two of the three species were collected in the Gaspe peninsula,  "all from the same pasture, and picked on the same day and measured at the same time by the same person with the same apparatus"

The data set consist of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris ris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor . Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the  sepals and petals, in centimeters. Based on the combination of these four features, Fisher developed a linear discriminant model to distinguish the species from each other.

Libraries Used

* Pandas - for the DataFrame data structure. It allows us to investigate CSV files . It is a Python library used for working with data sets. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data.

* CSV - (Comma Separated Values) is a simple file format used to store tabular data. 

* NumPy - is a general-purpose array-processing package. It provides a high-performance multidimensional array object, and it facilitates mathematical on large numbers of data. 

* Matplotlib - used for data visualization, typically in the form of plots, graphs and charts.

* Seaborn library - used for visualizing the explorative statistical plots of data.

* Warnings - we tell Panda to ignore future warning message generated by Pandas.
